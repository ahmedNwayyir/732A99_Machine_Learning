Linköping University, 1st semester 2019 


## Intended learning outcomes

After completion of the course the student should at an advanced level be able to:

- use relevant concepts and methods from machine learning in order to formulate, structure and solve practical problems that involve large or complex data,
- make an inference for the parameter values for commonly used machine learning models,
- use machine learning models for prediction and decision making,
- estimate the quality of the machine learning models,
- select a suitable model in situations with a limited or no information about the underlying dependencies in the data,
- implement machine learning models in a programming language and use existing machine learning software in order to analyze large and/or complex datasets, make predictions and estimate the uncertainty of these predictions.


## Course content

The course introduces main concepts and tools in probabilistic machine learning which are necessary for professional work and research in data analytics.

- introduction to and overview of machine learning (including regression, classification, supervised and unsupervised learning) and its application areas,
- Nearest Neighbors and Naïve Bayes,
- discriminant analysis, logistic regression and decision trees,
- model selection and uncertainty estimation: holdout method, cross-validation, AIC, bootstrap confidence intervals,
- linear regression and regularization methods (Ridge, LASSO),
- splines, generalized linear and additive models,
- Principal component analysis (PCA) and Principal component regression (PCR),
- kernel smoothers, kernel trick and support vector machines,
- neural networks,
- bagging, boosting and random forests,
- Online learning and mixture models.
